## Introduction
**Icarus Framework**

This is a ported Plugin for `Kid Icarus: Uprising` that was previously made for Libshark2NTR (Offline)
* I only ported it to USA because I'm only familiar that most of the codes work for that version!

## Links and more

* You need to place the `.3gx` into `sd:\luma\plugins\0004000000030100\` (if you don't have a folder called `0004000000030100` yet, simply create it!)
